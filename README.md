Dotfiles
=========

Just a collection of convenient configuration files and an install script
so I can get working more quickly with a new linux distribution.

Existing (old) dotfiles are moved from ~ to ~/dotfiles_old/

The script creates symlinks from the home directory to the dotfiles in this repository.
